##How Pensions Work
- Live <a href="http://www.myajc.com/news/atl-pensions/">here</a>, ran 10/27/13 on mysite only
- Hastily built with Bootstrap
- `tabs.html` pulls in this and Ashlyn's table of fund liabilities, expects them to live in child folders

####ToDo 
- [ ] Combine these files instead of using iFrames - loading Bootstrap (and jQuery) 3x unnecessarily
- [ ] Use consistent styles between tabs - mobile version of table has corners that are much more round than the panels
