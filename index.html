							<h5> defined contribution</h5>
							Workers in government plans may have to pay a percentage of their salaries toward the pension system each paycheck. The government also makes an Annual Required Contribution, which is calculated by a complex formula that takes into consideration the annual normal pension costs and the money needed to close the funding gap within  the period of time set by the pension board.</li>
							<li>
								<h5>defined benefit</h5>
								A defined benefit plan guarantees an employee will receive a specific sum of money each month once retired. That sum is typically calculated based on years of service and the average salary earned over the last years of work.
