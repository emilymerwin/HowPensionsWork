					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Defined contribution</strong><br>
							These 401(k)s and similar tax-sheltered plans are ones where the employee or company contribute a certain amount of money each year for the worker’s future retirement. In these plans, employees bear the risk that they won’t save enough or investments will do poorly.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							<strong>Defined benefit</strong><br>
							These traditional pension plans provide that an employee will receive a specific income once retired. Employers make contributions, and workers may also have to contribute a percentage of their salaries. In these plans, the employer bears the risk that they won’t save enough or investments will do poorly. For public pension plans, the government makes an Annual Required Contribution, which is calculated by a complex formula that takes into consideration the annual pension costs and the money needed to close the funding gap within a period of time set by the pension board.

							With traditional pension plans, employers rely on complex mathematical formulas to try to estimate future investment earnings and future pension payouts so that enough money is available to pay promised benefits. A pension is underfunded if projected costs exceed projected assets over a period of time known as an amortization period.

				</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<ul>
						<li>
							If employers fail to require adequate contributions, make poor investments or rely on unreasonable projections of future costs or earnings, pension debts mount. If the funding level drops so low that assets are being drained, employers have to turn to other sources of revenue, such as tax hikes, to pay benefits or may seek to curtail benefits. In Illinois, public pensions have been deemed in crisis, and in Detroit the city has cited pension debt in applying for bankruptcy. Big pension debts also can weaken a government’s bond rating, which increases borrowing costs.
